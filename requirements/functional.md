### Task 1.1 Functional Requirements
1. As a customer I want to schedule the delivery of the ingredients so that I can be at home or tell the neighbor to receive it.
2. As a customer I want to browse the meal ingredients individually so that I can create the variant of the meal from the ingredients which takes the least amount of time to deliver my doorstep.
3. As a customer I want to track the status of my order so that in case the delivery is postponed (for reasons beyond the catering services control like traffic), I know where the delivery currently is, when it might arrive and whether to stay at home / inform the neighbor about the arrival.
4. As a busy mother of five children I want to search for meals that I can prepare quickly so that I can reduce the time required for preparing the lunch meals of my children and go to work earlier.
5. As a vegan I want to search for vegan meals explicitly so that I don't have to check the ingredients of each meal if it matches my vegan diet.
