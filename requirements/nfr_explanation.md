Non-Functional Requirement: Easily extendable  
	- Why it is important
		- Issue background: The software must be extendable for several reasons, e. g. new meal types, additional code for specific platforms (means portability), security features if a (local) law changes, changing individual modules e. g. the database, if a better way to store data emerges on the market, etc.
		- Implementation wise: Deciding on an architecture for a prototype eases the decision for the architecture of the respective module parts latter in development. It also leads to insights, what might be optimal and what might be less optimal for the rest of the architecture.
- How these requirements relate to each other: Vegans are only one of many groups of customers, which there will be probably more in the future. By considering them in the prototype, the foundation for adding new groups is created, which means the software becomes extensible for adding more groups in the future.
