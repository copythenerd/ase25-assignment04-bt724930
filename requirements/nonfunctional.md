### Task 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1. As a resident of a large apartment building I want the system to be responsive so that if there is a high in internet usage of the apartments residents, I am still able to reach the service to make my order.
2. As a customer I want the system to be intuitively usable so that I don't have to use a lot of time to (again, after long periods of not using it) figure out how the system works .
3. As a I lead software developer I want the system to be easily extendable so that my team can easily adapt to new requirements given by customers (e. g. meal types).
4. As a server administrator I want the program to be robust so that crashes do not cause the loss of customer orders if I e. g. add a patch to the server on which the program runs.
5. As a mobile user I want the service to be lightweight in terms of memory and internet usage so that my data volume and battery do not get drained on unnecessarily.
