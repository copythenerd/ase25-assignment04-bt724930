Functional Requirement: Search for vegan meals
	- Why it is important: 
		- Issue background: Vegans (and other proper subsets of omnivores) have become increasingly common other the recent years and the trend suggests that they will not become less in the future. By aligning the service catalog with their dietary orientation, it is ensured that the service can also be used by those groups.
		- Implementation wise: Most of the time, the customer will interact with the service via browsing by using a filter mechanic to find a meal that matches his demand. Implementing such a mechanic in the service prototype means that there is already a basis for such a filter mechanic that can be expanded upon later.
